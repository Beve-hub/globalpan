                Our firm's business structure provides distinct client service advantages. Portfolio managers, analysts, and investment committee members are one and the same. They also meet directly with our clients. On a daily basis, they are involved in the analysis, design, and implementation of portfolios.
                <br />
                <br />
                As a result of our team approach, each member must synthesize and analyze relevant macro-economic data, industry trends, and company financials as a basis for investment recommendations. This level of daily involvement keeps each member acutely aware of market fundamentals and emphasizes the accountability links between idea generation, analysis, investment recommendation, and ultimately, account performance. This increased accountability helps align interests more closely with our clientsâ€™ interests. Accessibility and accountability, combined with an experienced support staff, provide us the tools to deliver a superior level of customer service.
